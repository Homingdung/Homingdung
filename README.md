# Hey! This is Mingdong!
![nonlinear](https://github.com/Homingdung/Homingdung/blob/main/nonlinear.gif)


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a mathematical student, my current mathematical interests are in applied mathematics, dynamical systems and computational mathematics.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to be a drum player in orchestra and a guitar player in a rock band. When I am not doing mathematics, I always play the guitar. 
- ðŸ“– I love reading books, especially for books about history and culture. I have a personal [readingList](https://github.com/Homingdung/readingList) for my mathematics study, containing some classical references books about mathematics I read, which could be helpful for university mathematics study.
