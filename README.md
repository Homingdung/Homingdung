# About me 
## *Hello! My name is Mingdong, and I am a second-year mathematics student at [The University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/). My current mathematical interests are in applied mathematics, especially nonlinear dynamics, computational mathematics*. 



I am a student member of SIAM and a regular participant in SIAM events.

I used to be a drum player in orchestra and a guitar player in a rock band. When I am not doing mathematics, I always play the guitar. 

I am also a language lover and I can speak a little bit Russian and Cantonese. Just like mathematics, languages also use smybols to decipher the world.

I love reading books, both math and non-math: especially for books about history and culture. I have a respository called [readingList](https://github.com/Homingdung/readingList), containing some classical references books about mathematics I read, which could be helpful for university mathematics study.


# Course I am currently taking:
+ Vector calculus
+ Mathematical analysis
+ Complex function
+ Differential equations and fourier analysis
+ Modeling with differential equation
+ Introduction to Scientific computation
+ Probabilty model and methods
+ Statistical model and methods


# Technical skills:
+ Python, Matlab, R, latex, HTML, CSS, Javascript.
